      A stand-alone Senior High School (SHS) is a secondary school that operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or Integrated School (IS). It has its own location and a separate school head (principal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS, which is located within an existing JHS or IS and shares the same school head.

      A stand-alone Senior High School is a separate institution dedicated to Grades 11 and 12. It offers specialized upper secondary education based on the chosen tracks and strands.
